    \item Would learn a different policy than playing a fixed opponent since the opponent would also be changing in this case.
    \item May not be able to learn an optimal strategy as the opponent keeps changing also.
    \item Could get stuck in loops.
    \item Policy could remain static since on average they would draw each iteration.
\end{itemize}
