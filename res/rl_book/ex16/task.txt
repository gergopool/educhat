{Exercise 2.11 (programming)}

Make a figure analogous to Figure 2.6 for the non-stationary case outlined in Exercise 2.5. Include the constant-step-size $\varepsilon$-greedy algorithm with $\alpha=0.1$. Use runs of 200,000 steps and, as a performance measure for each algorithm and parameter setting, use the average reward over the last 100,000 steps.
