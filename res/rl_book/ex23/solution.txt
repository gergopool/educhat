If the agent keeps going randomly, it will reach the end of the maze with probability 1, so the value of $G$ under most strategies is $1$. What you actually want is for the thing to leave the maze as quickly as possible.\\

Note also that there are some instances in which the agent might just get stuck in a loop. You would have to impose another rule to put the agent into a terminal state here.
