{Exercise 7.1}

In Chapter 6 we noted that the Monte Carlo error can be written as the sum of TD errors (6.6) if the value estimates don’t change from step to step. Show that the $n$-step error used in (7.2) can also be written as a sum TD errors (again if the value estimates don’t change) generalizing the earlier result.
