\begin{itemize}
    \item General arguments given earlier about the benefits of TD are independent of $\alpha$
    \item Increases in $\alpha$ make the curve more 
    \item Decreases in $\alpha$ make the curve more smooth but make it converge slower.
    \item We see enough of a range here to decide between the two methods
\end{itemize}
