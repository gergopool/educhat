Note that the pole will fall eventually with probability 1
\begin{equation}
    G_t = - \gamma^{T - t}.
\end{equation}
Whereas in the continuing case the value is
\begin{equation}
    G_t = - \sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}} \gamma^{k - t},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{K}$ is the set of times after $t$ at which the pole falls over.
