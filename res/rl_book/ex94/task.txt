{Exercise 8.6}

The analysis above assumed that all of the \emph{b} possible next states were equally likely to occur. Suppose instead that the distribution was highly skewed, that some of the \emph{b} states were much more likely to occur than most. Would this strengthen or weaken the case for sample updates over expected updates? Support your answer.
