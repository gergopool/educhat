We condition on taking action $a$ in state $s$.
\[
    q_\pi(s, a) = \Epi{}[\rho_{t+1:T-1} G_t | S_t = s, A_t = s]
\]
with returns generated from $b$. We estimate this quantity by
\[
    Q(s, a) = \frac{\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}(s, a)} \rho_{t+1:T-1} G_t}{\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}(s, a)} \rho_{t+1:T-1}}
\]
where $\mathcal{T}(s, a)$ now contains timestamps of visits to state-action pairs.
