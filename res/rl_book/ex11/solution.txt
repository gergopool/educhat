At some point after step 10, the agent will find the optimal value. It will then choose this value greedily. The small step-size parameter (small relative to the initialisation value of 5) means that the estimate of the optimal value will converge slowly towards its true value.\\

It is likely that this true value is less than 5. This means that, due to the small step size, one of the sub-optimal actions will still have a value close to 5. Thus, at some point, the agent begins to act sub-optimally again.
