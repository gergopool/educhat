{Exercise 9.5}

Suppose you are using tile coding to transform a seven-dimensional continuous state space into binary feature vectors to estimate a state value function $\hat{v}(s, \vec{w}) \approx v_\pi(s)$. You believe that the dimensions do not interact strongly, so you decide to use eight tilings of each dimension separately (stripe tilings), for $7 \times 8 = 56$ tilings. In addition, in case there are some pairwise interactions between the dimensions, you also take all $\binom{7}{2} = 21$ pairs of dimensions and tile each pair conjunctively with rectangular tiles. You make two tilings for each pair of dimensions, making a grand total of $21 \times 2 + 56 = 98$ tilings. Given these feature vectors, you suspect that you still have to average out some noise, so you decide that you want learning to be gradual, taking about 10 presentations with the same feature vector before learning nears its asymptote. What step-size parameter $\alpha$ should you use? Why?
