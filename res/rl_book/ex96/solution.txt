Charts show averages of 200 runs. We see that in the $b=3$ case the uniformly distributed updates overtakes the on-policy updates much quicker. This is due to the greater complexity of the state-space (the number of states on which the value of the starting state depends is exponential in $b$), of which the on-policy updates neglects large portions. \\
