{Exercise 4.9 (programming): Gambler's Problem}

Implement value iteration for the gambler's problem and solve it for $p_h = 0.25$ and $p_h = 0.55$. In programming, you may find it convenient to introduce two dummy states corresponding to termination with capital of $0$ and $100$, giving them values of $0$ and $1$ respectively. Show your results graphically, as in Figure 4.3. Are your results stable as $\theta \to 0$?
