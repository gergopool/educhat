{Exercise 7.3}

Why do you think a larger random walk task (19 states instead of 5) was used in the examples of this chapter? Would a smaller walk have shifted the advantage to a different value of $n$? How about the change in left-side outcome from 0 to -1 made in the larger walk? Do you think that made any difference in the best value of $n$?
