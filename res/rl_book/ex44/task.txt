{Exercise 4.2}

In Example 4.1, suppose a new state $15$ is added to the gridworld just below state $13$, and its actions, \texttt{left}, \texttt{up}, \texttt{right}, and \texttt{down}, take the agent to states $12$, $13$, $14$, and $15$, respectively. Assume that the transitions from the original states are unchanged. What, then, is $v_\pi(15)$ for the equiprobable random policy? Now suppose the dynamics of state $13$ are also changed, such that action down from state $13$ takes the agent to the new state $15$. What is $v_\pi(15)$ for the equiprobable random policy in this case?
