{Exercise 6.4}

The specific results shown in the right graph of the random walk example are dependent on the value of the step-size parameter, $\alpha$. Do you think the conclusions about which algorithm is better would be affected if a wider range of $\alpha$ values were used? Is there a different, fixed value of $\alpha$ at which either algorithm would have performed significantly better than shown? Why or why not?
