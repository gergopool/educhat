- Sample Efficiency: Use efficient exploration, transfer learning, or model-based methods.
- Non-Stationarity: Employ experience replay and adaptive learning rates.
- High-Dimensional State Spaces: Apply function approximation methods like deep neural networks.
- Reward Design: Carefully engineer reward functions or use reward shaping.
- Exploration-Exploitation: Balance with epsilon-greedy or exploration bonuses.
- Sample Bias: Correct bias in off-policy learning with importance sampling.
