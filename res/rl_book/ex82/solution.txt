The update that we use is the same as the $n$-step TD update, only multiplied by the importance sampling ratio and with the control variate added. 
\[
    G_{t:h} \doteq \rho_t (R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1:h}) + (1 - \rho_t) V_{h-1}(S_t)
\]
The algorithm is therefore the same, but with these steps replacing the old returns calculations, using the latest available value function.\\

If you take the recursion relation literally then we should get a control variate for each of the intermediary states $(t+1, \dots, t+n)$, but I don't think that this is what is intended as this would just increase variance further.
