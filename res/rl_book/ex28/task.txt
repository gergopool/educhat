{Exercise 3.12}

The Bellman equation (3.14) must hold for each state for the value function $v_\pi$ shown in Figure 3.2 (right) of Example 3.5. Show numerically that this equation holds for the center state, valued at $+0.7$, with respect to its four neighbouring states, valued at $+2.3$, $+0.4$, $-0.4$, and $+0.7$. (These numbers are accurate only to one decimal place.)
