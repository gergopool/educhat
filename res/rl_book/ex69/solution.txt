Could have used DP, but probably did the following calculation.\\

First note that
\[
    V(s) = \E{}[\mathds{1}\{\textsf{terminate on right from } S\}] = \P{}(\textsf{terminate on right from } S).
\]
Also recognise that symmetry now implies $V(C) = 0.5$. Now
\begin{align*}
    V(E) &= \frac12 \times 1 + \frac12 \times V(D) \\
         &= \frac12 + \frac14[V(C) + V(E)],
\end{align*}
so $V(E) = \frac56$. We then get $V(D) = \frac46$ and we can calculate the other states in the same way.
