Advantages:
- Sample Efficiency: They often require fewer real interactions with the environment to learn a good policy.
- Guarantees: Some model-based algorithms can provide theoretical guarantees on convergence and optimality.

Disadvantages:
- Model Bias: The quality of the learned model can introduce bias, impacting policy quality.
- Model Complexity: Building an accurate model of complex environments can be challenging.
- Computational overhead: Planning with models can be computationally expensive, limiting real-time applications.
